# process-once-through-model-study
Evaluate once-through runs of PROCESS's models. The purpose here is to run PROCESS's models multiple times using the same parameters in order to assess the stability of the model responses over multiple calls.

## Usage
This notebook uses the `once-through-model-study` branch of the https://github.com/jonmaddock/process-uq fork: this runs 10 model calls and outputs an MFILE.DAT after each.
